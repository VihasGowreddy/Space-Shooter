# Space-Shooter
Basic classic 2D platform space shooter

Creates a classic space shooter with 5 waves of enemy ships floating down to the other end. One enemy ship is detached and moves faster
than the others and is given the ability to shoot at your ship as well. When this ship is destroyed, another enemy ship detaches and 
does the same thing. The user is given 3 lives and it is game over if they lose all 3.

There are 5 waves of these enemy ships and if the user is able to make it through all of these rounds, a boss ship will appear and takes 40
hits to destroy. After destroying the boss, the user wins the game.
